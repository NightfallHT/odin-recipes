                    <h2>How to prepare?</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat 10 litres of unpasteurized milk to 38 degrees
                            celsius in two batches. Afterward
                            pour 2 tablespoons of cheese rennet into each milk
                            batch. Rennet is an enzyme from the
                            calf belly mucous membrane that cause the milk to
                            solidify. It can be purchased at an
                            apothecary. Instead of renner you may try to use
                            plants with coagulating properties like
                            thistles, artichokes, buttercups and butterwort.
                            Yellow bedstraw is noted as a
                            particularly strong option. The coagulating
                            properties of these plants are not clearly
                            defined, thus it may be risky to use vegetable
                            rennet in these situations. A defining
                            characteristic of western cheese culture is and has
                            long been, rennet of animal origin.
                        </li>
                        <li>When the rennet has been added the mix should be
                            left to solidify for 30 minutes. To
                            remove the whey from the curd the mass is poured
                            into a colander that is rotated around
                            the edge. Much of the whey is extracted in this
                            manner. The now fairly solid curd is
                            placed in a towel and squeezed until all the whey is
                            removed.</li>
                        <li>Repeat the above with 5 litres of old-fashioned
                            milk.</li>
                        <li>Add your desired spices before the curd is
                            completely dry. Salt is not only used to
                            enhance the taste but also improve durability and
                            prevent mold.</li>
                        <li>When the curd is ready it should be swept into a dry
                            towel and placed in a mould. The
                            towel should be changed daily. The cheese should be
                            turned every morning and evening for
                            at least 3-4 weeks. If there is any mold it should
                            be cut off immediately. Keep the
                            cheese on plates with weights on.</li>
                        <li>The cheese should be preserved for at least 5 weeks
                            before it is ready to be eaten. The
                            longer time the tastier the cheese. It should be
                            kept cool but not cold. The cheese
                            could be kept in a turned off refrigerator, which
                            has the added advantage of keeping it
                            safe from insects and rodents.</li>
